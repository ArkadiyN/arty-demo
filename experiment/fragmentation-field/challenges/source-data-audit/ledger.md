# Source-data audit ledger — ordnance-1944 and Tolch-1938

Provenance and verdict record for every artifact that consumes numbers from
`doc-reference/wound-ballistics/ordnance-dept-1944-shell-fragment-damage/` or
`doc-reference/wound-ballistics/tolch-1938-m48-panel-pit-fragmentation/`.

Repairs are **deferred by design** — this ledger is the map that drives the
redo, not a record of fixes. `src/arty/` is assessed, never changed here.

## 1. The discriminator

Evidence: [`checks/column-identity-energy-closure.py`](checks/column-identity-energy-closure.py)

Each 1944 Ordnance shell page prints **two tables interleaved row-by-row** from
a two-column scan — CASUALTIES and PERFORATION OF 1/8-IN. MILD STEEL. Column
identity is not derivable from the layout. The one relation internal to the
table is the source's own definition: every row lists the *lightest effective
fragment* `(m, v)`, so `½mv²` must reproduce the caption's stated 58 ft-lb
casualty criterion, and only on the casualties column.

Run on the merged `ordnance-1944.md` (post-`e62ff71`, which repaired the OCR
row-order swaps):

| shell      | line of pair | range grid | B(20 ft) | ½mv² across all rows | identity       |
| ---------- | ------------ | ---------- | -------- | -------------------- | -------------- |
| 75mm M48   | **first**    | 20–400 ft  | 0.213    | 57.5 – 58.0 ft-lb    | **CASUALTIES** |
| 75mm M48   | second       | 20–225 ft  | 0.106    | 271.9 – 828.6 ft-lb  | perforation    |
| 105mm M1   | **first**    | 20–500 ft  | 0.231    | 57.7 – 58.2 ft-lb    | **CASUALTIES** |
| 105mm M1   | second       | 20–300 ft  | 0.194    | 247.8 – 930.1 ft-lb  | perforation    |
| 155mm M107 | **first**    | 20–600 ft  | 0.291    | 55.9 – 58.2 ft-lb    | **CASUALTIES** |
| 155mm M107 | second       | 20–400 ft  | 0.247    | 247.8 – 1145.8 ft-lb | perforation    |

Uniform across all three shells: **first line of each printed row-pair is
CASUALTIES.** No ambiguity, no shell-specific exception.

Three things that look like discriminators and are not:

- **Max range.** Casualties runs *longer* (400/500/600 ft) than perforation
    (225/300/400 ft) — but nothing in the scan says so. `b-vs-range-75mm.py`
    asserted the reverse and had no way to tell.
- **`B` non-increasing.** True of *both* columns, every row, all three shells.
    Zero discriminating power, yet cited as a corroborating check.
- **Caption order.** The two `TABLE nn` lines print in the opposite order to the
    two caption lines (`TABLE 44 / TABLE 43 / CASUALTIES / PERFORATION…`), so
    even the table-number-to-caption mapping is unresolved by position.

## 2. How the inversion entered and spread

1. **`card.md` summarised each table-pair into loose fields** — one column's
    `B` beside the other column's range (75mm: `B@20 = 0.213` is casualties,
    `20–225 ft` is perforation). Coherent-looking, and wrong as a pair.
1. **`b-vs-range-75mm.py` used the card's range field as the column-identity
    discriminator** (docstring: *"the column carrying Table 43 is identified by
    its max range (225 ft), which matches the challenge doc's statement"*). A
    lossy summary became ground truth for the one fact it did not guarantee.
    The corroborating test it cites (`B` monotone) cannot discriminate.
1. **The 75mm r=40 "row-swap correction" is an artefact of that inversion.**
    The script invented a transposition at r=40 to restore monotonicity *within
    its inverted assignment*. In the current file, `r=40` closes at 57.5 ft-lb
    in first-line position like every other row — the pair is in normal order.
1. **`b-vs-range-105mm.py` and `-155mm.py` copied the method**, both landing on
    the perforation column.
1. **The error was then found — twice — and never actioned.**
    `initial-conditions-105mm.md` §(b)/(c) and `initial-conditions-155mm.md`
    both run the energy closure correctly, both conclude the b-vs-range scripts
    used the wrong column, and both defer the fix ("*out of scope — flagged for
    a follow-up fix*"). The follow-up never happened.
1. **A factor-of-4 arithmetic slip inside `initial-conditions-105mm.md`
    admitted the wrong column first.** Line 44 reports `0.035 oz @ 2700 f/s ≈  62.0 ft-lb — within ~7% of 58`. The correct value is **247.8 ft-lb**. That
    bogus "verified" line sits above a reconstructed table labelled *"Table 51
    CASUALTIES"* carrying perforation values — and it is that pre-correction
    table, not the corrected one 40 lines below it, that
    `drag-coefficient-calibration.py` copied and labelled *"corrected
    identification"*.
1. **Propagation by import.** `b-vs-range-familyA.py` loads the three Family B
    modules and reuses their `CARD_R_FT`/`CARD_B` directly — the newest analysis
    inherits the inversion without re-typing a digit. Two further scripts
    inherit from those.

## 3. Ordnance-1944 consumers

Verdict column: **sound** (unaffected) / **shifted** (same conclusion, different
numbers) / **void** (conclusion does not survive). Filled in Phase 3.

The 75✓/105✗/155✓ pattern repeats verbatim across five scripts: the 105mm
series was copied from the pre-correction table in `initial-conditions-105mm.md`
while the 75mm and 155mm series came from correctly-identified sources. A single
`DATA` block therefore mixes two different criteria across its three entries —
the shape of the velocity-decay curve it fits is not one physical relation.

`initial-conditions-probe1.py` / `-probe2.py` read only `src/arty` state and
carry no source data — **not affected**.

These consume `DragParams` defaults whose *justification* is the tainted
velocity-decay comparison. They are only void if Phase 4 voids the parameter.

Phase 6; none can be repaired before Phase 3 assigns verdicts.

## 4. Tolch-1938 consumers

Independent of the column question. The Tolch defect is different in kind: the
card's **"Drag Model Relevance"** section recommends the velocity-sweep density
collapse as the drag calibration anchor, and modeler memory
(`gotcha_tolch_remaining_velocity_is_shell_not_fragment`) records that the axis
is the *shell's* velocity at burst — a burst-geometry observable near-insensitive
to drag, i.e. the least drag-sensitive number in the report. The correction
lives only in agent memory; the card still says it. Every anchor in that card is
a bare line number, into a file that has already been partially re-extracted.

"UNVERIFIED, do not cite" — two extractions disagree, one is provably
non-monotonic, no source PDF retained in-repo. Capped at one re-acquisition

## 5. Phase 1 result — ordnance-1944 re-baselined

Six tables now live under
`doc-reference/wound-ballistics/ordnance-dept-1944-shell-fragment-damage/tables/`,
each with a `.invariant` beside it. `uv run src/utils/check-table-invariants.py doc-reference/ --all` exits 0 — **0 / 6
failed**, 33 checks over 65 rows.

Independently verified cell-by-cell against the scan by three separate
verification passes (one per shell page-block, comparison only — no editing, no
deciding): **315 cells checked, zero discrepancies.** The three open questions
carried into Phase 1 all resolved:

- The 105mm and 155mm casualties columns *do* share identical `(m, v)` pairs at
    matching ranges — confirmed against the scan, not a cross-copy. Both shells
    list `V0 = 3,500 f/s` and the criterion is a fixed energy, so `m(v)` is
    shell-independent; only `N`, `B` and the final range step differ.
- 155mm r=80 ft `B` prints as `..0148` (stray leading dot); `0.0148` confirmed.
- **75mm r=40 is NOT transposed.** The pair sits in normal first/second order
    like every other row, and closes at 57.5 ft-lb in first-line position. The
    swap that `b-vs-range-75mm.py` applies is an artefact of its own inverted
    column assignment and must not be carried forward.

The perforation tables have **no closure of their own** — the source states no
numeric perforation threshold, and `½mv²` on those rows runs 272–1146 ft-lb,
rising with range. Their identity rests on elimination against the casualties
table, which is only sound while both halves of each pair stay transcribed
together. Each `.invariant` says so, and says explicitly that the monotonicity
checks are structural sanity only and can never serve as a column-identity test
— that misuse is what inverted three committed scripts.

## 6. Phase 2 result — Tolch-1938

Evidence: [`checks/tolch-spray-table-closure.py`](checks/tolch-spray-table-closure.py)

**2c — the "UNVERIFIED, do not cite" figure is RESOLVED, and no re-acquisition
dispatch was needed.** The card treats the cumulative base-fragment velocity
distribution as an unreadable *measurement* with two irreconcilable extractions.
It is not a measurement: the report states it is *derived* — "The proportion of
base fragments remaining after giving the shell an increment in velocity may be
obtained from the above table" (anchor: `**Total hits per unit solid angle of the base spray.**`). Recomputing it from the Panel A totals column settles it:

| v (f/s) | derived from table | heuristic reading | vision reading |
| ------- | ------------------ | ----------------- | -------------- |
| 700     | 79.8 %             | 80 %              | 20 %           |
| 1085    | 48.0 %             | 48 %              | 15 %           |
| 1450    | 28.7 %             | 29 %              | 25 %           |
| 1685    | 13.9 %             | 14 %              | 18 %           |
| 2130    | 7.2 %              | 7 %               | 7 %            |

The heuristic reading reproduces the table to 0.3 pp; the vision reading is off
by up to 59.8 pp. **The heuristic reading is correct** and the figure is
citable: 80 % > 700, 48 % > 1085, 29 % > 1450, 14 % > 1685, 7 % > 2130 f/s. The
Phase 2c dispatch budget is unspent.

Caveat that must go in the card: these are ***shell*** remaining velocities. The
quantity is the fraction of base fragments whose charge-imparted velocity
exceeds the shell velocity cancelling it — burst geometry, **not** fragment drag.

**2b — BLOCKED. The spray tables do not close and must not be transcribed as
they stand.** The report states the totals were obtained by adding the three
fragment types ("were added together"), so `total == perf + penet + dents` must
hold in every (velocity, panel) cell. It fails in **21 of 33** cells:

- Base spray: 8 cells fail. Worst — Panel B @ 2130 f/s sums to 1.12, stated 3.12.
- Nose spray: 13 cells fail. Worst — **Panel A static sums to 1.96, stated
    16.09.**

Six of the failures are exactly ±0.20, a quantised signature of single-digit OCR
errors rather than rounding (three 2-d.p. terms can only round-trip to ±0.015).

The nose-spray Panel A static cell is **material to the card**, which currently
reports "Total hits per u.s.a. (Panel A): 16.09 (static) → 21.45 (2,130 f/s)" —
a modest 1.33× rise. If 1.96 is the true static value the rise is 10.9×, which
is also what Panel B shows (2.42 → 26.31, 10.9×). The card's nose-spray
narrative is therefore either mild or dramatic depending on one OCR digit, and
the pattern favours the dramatic reading. **Not decided here** — deciding it
needs the original scan, and it is exactly the kind of call the fidelity rule
forbids making from a degraded extraction.

**2d — the card's "Drag Model Relevance" section is confirmed wrong.** The
source is explicit that "remaining velocity when burst" is the *shell's*
velocity, tabulated as a firing condition ("the following table shows the
conditions under which the rounds were fired… Average remaining velocity when
burst"). The base-spray density collapse against it is vector addition of shell
velocity and charge-imparted ejection velocity — burst geometry, near-insensitive
to fragment drag. The card recommends it as *the* drag calibration anchor. This
matches the modeler-memory gotcha
(`gotcha_tolch_remaining_velocity_is_shell_not_fragment`), whose correction never
reached the card.

**Anchor rot confirmed and worse than recorded.** The card cites the spray
tables at `tolch-1938.md` lines 553–684. Those lines now hold panel-layout OCR
garbage; the real tables sit at **813–965**, roughly 250 lines away. Every anchor
in that card is a bare line number.

## 7. Remaining work

- **Phase 2b** — blocked on resolving 21 non-closing cells; needs a better scan
    of the spray-table pages, not another extraction pass over the same one.
- **Phase 3** — downstream verdicts (§3, §4 verdict columns).
- **Phase 4** — `src/arty` assessment (§3c).
- **Phase 5** — independent verification of this ledger.
- **Phase 6** — surface reconciliation (§3d).
